## Hi there 👋  
Junior dev exploring ideas, building projects, and growing every day.


## 🧪 Side Projects

- 🎉 **Eventique**  
  Created to practice backend API design and authentication with technologies I knew well.  
  An event manager where users can log in, create detailed events, and get a shareable link.  
  From that link, friends can RSVP and add their info, which then shows to the event creator.

- 🐾 **[Mystikitty](https://mystikitty.nightstars.space)**  
  Started as a way to fully explore the JavaScript ecosystem.  
  Users log in and get a unique shareable link where others can send anonymous messages.  
  It’s a full-stack project built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

Comfortable with: ASP.NET Core, EF Core, LINQ, HTML, Tailwind, JS (vanilla + React basics), SQL Server  
Exploring: React (deeper), Node.js, MongoDB, Java, Python, GSAP  
and more to come.
